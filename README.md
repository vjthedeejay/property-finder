# Property Finder

This repository contains code that retrieves apartment and house listings from Craigslist that match certain criteria and posts the results to Slack.

The code is inspired and largely based on the following really useful and interesting blog post:
 [How I built a Slack bot to help me find an apartment in San Francisco](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/apartment-finding-slackbot/).
